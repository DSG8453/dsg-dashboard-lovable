# DSG Transport Secure Login Extension

This Chrome extension enables **secure, automatic login** for DSG Transport tools. Credentials are **NEVER visible** to users - just like Bitwarden.

## 🔒 How It Works

1. User clicks "Open Tool" in DSG Transport dashboard
2. Extension receives encrypted credentials (user never sees them)
3. Extension opens the tool's login page
4. Credentials are automatically filled
5. User just clicks the "Login" button

**Users cannot see, copy, or export the actual passwords.**

## 🏢 For IT Administrators

### Enterprise Deployment
1. Host the extension folder on internal server
2. Use Chrome Enterprise policies to force-install
3. Or deploy via company software distribution system

### Extension ID
Each installation generates a unique Extension ID. Users must enter this ID once in the DSG Transport dashboard.

### Security Notes
- Extension only communicates with `*.dsgtransport.net`, `*.dsgtransport.com`, and `*.teamdsgtransport.com`
- Credentials are passed via Chrome's secure messaging API
- No data is stored permanently - auto-clears after 5 minutes
